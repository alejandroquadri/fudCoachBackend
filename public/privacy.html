        This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and

      </p>

          transaction identifiers (no full payment card data is stored by us).
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h2>5. Health and sensitive data</h2>
      <p>
        Food, weight, and exercise logs may be sensitive. We use them only to
        provide app functionality, coaching experiences, and analytics that
        improve the service. We apply access controls and security measures
        appropriate for this data.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Sign in with Apple</h2>
      <p>
        If you sign in with Apple, we receive identifiers and the email Apple
        provides. You can manage this in your Apple ID settings.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Subscriptions and in-app purchases</h2>
      <p>
        Subscriptions are processed by Apple. We store only the information
        needed to confirm your active entitlements. For billing questions, you
        can manage your subscriptions in your Apple ID settings.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We share data only with service providers that help us operate the app,
        such as cloud hosting, analytics, and customer support. These providers
        are bound by contractual obligations and may not use your data for their
        own purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to
        provide the service. You can request deletion at any time (see “Your
        rights”). We may retain limited information to comply with legal
        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct,
        export, or delete your data, and to object to or restrict certain
        processing. To exercise these rights, contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@fud.coach">support@fud.coach</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Children</h2>
      <p>
        The app is not directed to children under the age required by local law
        to provide consent. If you believe a child provided us data, contact us
        and we will take appropriate action.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use technical and organizational measures designed to protect your
        data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we
        continually improve our safeguards.
      </p>

      <h2>13. International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your data may be processed in countries other than where you live. We
        apply protections consistent with applicable law when data is
        transferred internationally.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated
        version here and update the “Last updated” date.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Contact</h2>
      <p>
